# Fireflallay Mod
Did you not notice that mojang added the fireflies? No? Well, try giving a torch to an Allay and see what happens! 

This mod introduces a new mob called the Fireflally, a lit up Allay which behaves the same as the normal allay but it's orange and can be eaten by the frogs. For some strange reason, it does not kill frogs when eaten but instead gives them Regeneration IV for 5 seconds. Also the frog then produces a somewhat disgusting drop. Allay skin, which gives Levitation 3 for 10 seconds and Nausea for 5.

## Setup

Download the mod from Modrinth or CurseForge and drop it inside the the /mods/ folder. (works only with Fabric and requires Fabric API)
