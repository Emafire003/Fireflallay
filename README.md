# Fireflallay Mod
Did you not notice that mojang added the fireflies? No? Well, try giving a torch to an Allay and see what happens! 

With this mod all you firefly lovers will be satisfied once and for all! Have you ever tried giving a torch to an allay? No? For real? Well, after installing this mod you should, because you will ignite the hidden fire of the little magical creature turning it into a Firefl-allay! (Eh eh I know a very orignal name)

## The Fireflallay mob

This mob is a peculiar kind of ally, which floats around exactly like its normal version, but also looks like a firefly! It also emits fire particles while fire-flying around! As for the normal allay, it emits a block light of 15, making it look lit up, for a very cool firefly-ish effect:

To get this mob you will need an Allay and a torch. Giving a torch to the Allay will make it turn into a Fireflally. If you want your blue friend back, just give it a water bucket to cool him down.

## What do the frogs do when they see it?

Shor answer: they get hungry.
Long answer: They get hungry and prepare their tongues for a meal, that unlike the normal poisonuns fireflies regenerates their health! (Oh wow

## Is the allay safe in the frog's stomach?

Well no, it gets mostly digested and its skin is dropped upon being eaten. It gets cooled down too tho! You can eat its skin as well, although you should prepare for a nauseating small flight upwards.
